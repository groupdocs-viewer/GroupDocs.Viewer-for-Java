There might be the case when your document is not physically located on the disk. Instead, you have the document in the form of a stream. In this case, to avoid the overhead of saving stream as a file on disk, [GroupDocs.Viewer](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer) enables you to render the file streams directly.

The following are the steps to be followed:

*   Specify the method to obtain document stream; 
*   Pass method's name to [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer) class constructor.

Following code snippet serves this purpose.

```java
    public void loadDocumentFromStream() {
        try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(new FileInputStream("sample.docx"))) {
            HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources();
            viewer.view(viewOptions);
        }
    }
```
