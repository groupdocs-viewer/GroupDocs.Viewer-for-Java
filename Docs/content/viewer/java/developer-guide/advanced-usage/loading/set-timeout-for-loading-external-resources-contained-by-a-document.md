The documents may contain external resources such as graphics that should be loaded during document rendering. 

Before v19.12 default timeout was 100 seconds which may slow down rendering in case a service that provides external resources is down.

In v19.12 we've set default timeout to 30 seconds and enabled users to specify the desired timeout in [LoadOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/LoadOptions) class.

This feature is supported for:

*   [Word Processing File Formats](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/)   
      
    

The following code snippet shows how to set a timeout for loading external resources:

```java
    LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
    loadOptions.setResourceLoadingTimeout(5000);

    try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("sample.doc", loadOptions)) {

        HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources();
        viewer.view(viewOptions);
    }
```
