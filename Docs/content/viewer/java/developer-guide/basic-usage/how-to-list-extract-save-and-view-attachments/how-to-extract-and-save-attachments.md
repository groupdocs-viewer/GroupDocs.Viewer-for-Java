You can save/export attachments from Email documents, Outlook data files, Archives and PDF documents with only a few lines of code using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java API.

Follow these steps to get and save (export) attachments:

*   Instantiate [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer) object  for the file that contains attachment(s);
*   Call [getAttachments()](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer#getAttachments()) method which will return document attachments collection;
*   Iterate through attachments collection and save attachment by calling [saveAttachment(...)](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer#saveAttachment(java.lang.String,%20java.io.OutputStream)) method.

Following example demonstrates on how to get and save attachments from MSG files.

```java
    String outputPath = "C:\\output";
    try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("with_attachments.msg")) {
        List<Attachment> attachments = viewer.getAttachments();
        for (Attachment attachment : attachments) {
            String filePath = Path.combine(outputPath, attachment.getFileName());
            viewer.saveAttachment(attachment.getFileName(), new FileOutputStream(filePath));
        }
    }
```
